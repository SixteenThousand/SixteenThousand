## Hello!

If you're here then you have probably been directed here from my CV, in which 
case, you should find all the projects I have been working on over the past few
months. In particular, I would recommend you look at 
![RainSweeper](https://github.com/SixteenThousand/RainSweeper) to see a more polished
project (you can also see the end result of the code at 
![https://sixteenthousand.github.io/RainSweeper/](https://sixteenthousand.github.io/RainSweeper/))
 or take a look at my solutions to 2020's Advent of Code
![https://github.com/SixteenThousand/Advent-Of-Code-2020](https://github.com/SixteenThousand/Advent-Of-Code-2020)
  if you want to see a part of my learning process.

If you didn't come here from my CV, then feel free to look around. Maybe you'll find something that interests you.
