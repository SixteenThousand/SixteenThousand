## Hello!

If you're here then you have probably been directed here from my CV, in which 
case, you should find all the projects I have been working on over the past few 
months. In particular, I would recommend you look at 
![RainSweeper](https://github.com/SixteenThousand/RainSweeper) to see a more 
polished project (you can also see the end result of the code at 
<https://sixteenthousand.github.io/RainSweeper/>)
 or take a look at my Advent of Code solutions 
 <https://github.com/SixteenThousand/Advent-Of-Code> if you want to see a part 
 of my learning process.

Currently I'm just adding the finishing touches to 
[phase](https://github.com/SixteenThousand/Phase), a command-line tool that 
hopes to make bad version control (i.e. just adding v1,v2, etc to the file 
names) a bit less bad.

### About me
Hi, my name is Thomas, I'm a maths graduate currently looking for work in 
software development. I live in the UK (specifically the midlands), and these 
days I split my time between my cats and over-designing my neovim config.
I also sometimes get lost in the woods.
