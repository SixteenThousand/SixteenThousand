# Hello!

*Ask me about terminal escape sequences. I dare you.*

My name is Thomas; I studied maths at university, and these days I like 
writing command-line tools in [Golang](go.dev).

Before that I taught myself front end web development by building a game in 
pure JavaScript, called 
[RainSweeper](https://sixteenthousand.github.io/RainSweeper/), and learned 
about full-stack development at the [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) 
bootcamp, where helped to build another (now 3D!!) game, [Ready 
Salted](https://github.com/SixteenThousand/Ready-Salted).

Recently I've also been updating a useful little
[bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) tool I made to have 
end-to-end tests. You can see it here: 
[github.com/SixteenThousand/Yona](https://github.com/SixteenThousand/Yona).

## About

I live in the English Midlands, where I split my time between my hobbies of
