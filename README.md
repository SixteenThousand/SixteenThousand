## Hello!

If you're here then you have probably been directed here from my CV, in which 
case, you should find all the projects I have been working on over the past few 
months. In particular, I would recommend you look at 
![RainSweeper](https://github.com/SixteenThousand/RainSweeper) to see a more 
polished project (you can also see the end result of the code at 
<https://sixteenthousand.github.io/RainSweeper/>)
 or take a look at my Advent of Code solutions 
 <https://github.com/SixteenThousand/Advent-Of-Code> if you want to see a part 
 of my learning process.

Currently I'm working on 
![Tag-Explorer](https://github.com/SixteenThousand/Tag-Explorer), a desktop app 
that lets you browse through your filesystem with tags (as opposed to folders).  
If you didn't come here from my CV, then feel free to look around. Maybe you'll 
find something that interests you.

### About me
Hi, my name is Thomas, I'm a maths graduate currently looking for work in 
software development. I live in the UK (specifically the midlands), and these 
days I split my time between my cats and over-designing my neovim config.
I also sometimes get lost in the woods.
