## Hello!

Welcome to my most active social media presence! Here you can find all the 
projects I've worked on in the past few years. At the moment I am doing this 
year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) (although I am not 
trying to keep up to date with it). You can find my solutions 
[here](https://github.com/SixteenThousand/aoc-solutions-2024).

### About me

Hi, my name is Thomas, I'm a maths graduate currently looking for work in 
software development. I live in the UK (specifically the midlands), and 
these days I split my time between my cats and my terminal.
I also sometimes get lost in the woods.
