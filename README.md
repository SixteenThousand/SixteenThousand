## Hello!

If you're here then you have probably been directed here from my CV, in which 
case, you should find all the projects I have been working on over the past few
months. In particular, I would recommend you look at 
![RainSweeper](https://github.com/SixteenThousand/RainSweeper) to see a more polished
project (you can also see the end result of the code at 
![https://sixteenthousand.github.io/RainSweeper/](https://sixteenthousand.github.io/RainSweeper/))
 or take a look at my Advent of Code solutions
 ![](https://github.com/SixteenThousand/Advent-Of-Code)
  if you want to see a part of my learning process.

If you didn't come here from my CV, then feel free to look around. Maybe you'll find something that interests you.

### About me
Hi, my name is Thomas, I'm a maths graduate currently looking for work in software development. I live in the UK 
(specifically the midlands), and these days I split my time between my cats and over-designing my neovim config.
I also sometimes fight the Glorious Glasgow Haskell compiler.
